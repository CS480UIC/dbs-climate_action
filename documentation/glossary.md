# Relationships

### state_has_population:
Every state has some population given an year. This relationship defines the population value for each state for each year.

### state_reports_aqi:
This relationship states the air quality index reported by each state for a given year.

### state_emits_carobon_dioxide:
This relationship states the levels of carbon dioxide emitted by each state per year.

### state_encounters_natural_disaster:
This relationship shows that a state encounters a natural disaster. A particular state can encounter multiple natural disasters, though it isnâ€™t required to encounter a natural disaster. 

### state_causes_deforestation:
This relationship show that a state can cause deforestation.
