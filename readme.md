# Database description
Our project focuses on the several factors that affect our climate, especially in the United States. We look at data over the years for each state and list their impact on the deteriorating climate health. 
We are storing values for various entities like AQI, carbon emission, waste production, deforestation etc.
We are planning to use MySQL for the backend and Java & PHP for the web development. 
Our project is unique in a sense where we have all the information for each state into one database and anyone can fetch the information for any state for a given year. After a lot of research, we could not find all the data at a single source. We had to collect our data from multiple resources and merge them.
